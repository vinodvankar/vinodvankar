## A little about me

I am a Senior Frontend Developer, focusing on building scalable, high-performance user interfaces with Vue 3 and modern tooling. I care deeply about how things work, not just how they look — performance, architecture, and long-term maintainability matter to me.

Over time, my curiosity naturally pulled me beyond the browser. I started exploring Rust, backend systems, and even game development concepts.

I’m also motivated by a long-term vision of working on globally impactful products and exploring opportunities beyond my home country.

## What I enjoy working on

* Designing clean, maintainable frontend architectures
* Vue 3, Composition API, and ecosystem tooling
* Performance optimization and rendering strategies
* SSR, SSG, and SEO-friendly applications
* Learning Rust and backend fundamentals

---

### learning and applying

* Rust
* REST APIs
* Async concepts and architecture

## Current focus

Right now, I’m intentionally narrowing my focus to go deeper rather than wider:

* Building real projects that combine Nuxt with Rust backends
* Strengthening fundamentals in systems and backend design
* Gradually moving toward game development and creative tooling
