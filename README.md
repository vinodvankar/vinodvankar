## A little about me

I am a Senior Frontend Developer, focusing on building scalable, high-performance user interfaces with Vue 3 and modern tooling. I care deeply about how things work, not just how they look — performance, architecture, and long-term maintainability matter to me.

Over time, my curiosity naturally pulled me beyond the browser. I started exploring Rust, backend systems, and even game development concepts. My goal is simple but demanding: be the kind of engineer who understands the full system, from UI down to memory and async execution.

I’m also motivated by a long-term vision of working on globally impactful products and exploring opportunities beyond my home country.

## Current focus

Right now, I’m intentionally narrowing my focus to go deeper rather than wider:

## A bit more, beyond code

I enjoy learning continuously, thinking about how technology evolves, and building skills that stay valuable even as tools change.

Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, swimming, and consuming tech-focused content — from deep technical talks to product and career insights.
